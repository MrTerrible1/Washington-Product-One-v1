# 1. Core Principles

Washington Product One implements the **guest-only UX** for the Washington consumption OS.

Guiding constraints for v0.1:

1. **No login**
2. **No social graph**
3. **No creator tools**
4. **Static JSON only**
5. **Client-side UI only**
6. **VIA v0.1 is mocked** (face = real, spine = stub, brain = static)
7. **All events follow the WashingtonEvent schema**
8. **Predictive systems are simulated, not real**
9. **Mobile-first thinking even on desktop preview**

V0.1 is not the product — it is the **training ground** for VIA and the **UX shell** for the actual OS.
