<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's primary objective is to perform a series of comprehensive UI/UX refinement passes on a Washington Product One v0.1 guest-only app. The goal is to make the React frontend application look and feel like a world-class streaming service (e.g., Netflix, Max). The work has been hyper-focused on iteratively overhauling the  to create a polished content profile page. This involved multiple layout restructures, moving components between columns, adjusting spacing and proportions to fit specific viewport requirements, and ultimately unifying the content data model to remove all hardcoded narrative text from the JSX.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Application-Wide Polish:** Standardize navigation, tab styling, and replace the bottom VIA ribbon with a floating button. (Mostly complete from the previous session).
2.  **OnDemand Landing Page ():** Refine the hero banner, sidebar controls, and content rails. (Mostly complete from the previous session).
3.  **Content Detail Page ():** Completely overhaul the page into a modern, 3-column content profile. This has been the sole focus of the current session, with numerous iterative changes to meet precise layout and hierarchy goals defined by the user. The latest requirement was to add a new video with a long plot description to test the layout's dynamic content handling.
4.  **Broadcast Preview Page ():** Ensure styling is consistent with the app's design system. (Complete from the previous session).

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a React frontend. The agent's work in this session has been exclusively focused on . After numerous iterative refinements based on detailed user prompts, the page is now stable and features a sophisticated 3-column layout:
-   **Left Column:** A minimal set of controls (, , ).
-   **Center Column:** A 16:9 hero video preview, followed immediately by a tabbed section (, , , , ) where content expands vertically. Below the tab content, discovery rails (, etc.) are rendered.
-   **Right Column:** A compact sidebar with the video's title, logline, primary CTAs (, , , ), a More from this creator section, and a sponsor card.

Crucially, all narrative content (titles, loglines, synopses, plot descriptions, and credit billing blocks) is now driven by a unified data model in , with no hardcoded text in the components. A new video entry, Mathmagical I, has been added to test the layout with a large amount of plot text.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: The agent completed a data model unification task. This involved adding a new video entry for Mathmagical I to , including a very long  provided by the user. The agent then verified that the  layout correctly renders this new entry, with the  tab's content area expanding naturally to accommodate the long text without breaking the layout or introducing nested scrollbars.
- **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- **Agent Testing Done**: Y
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: screenshot tool
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- There are no pending issues or blockers. The agent has successfully completed all user requests from this session.

**Issues Detail:**
- None

**In progress Task List**:
- There are no tasks currently in progress.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Upcoming Tasks:**
-   Address the recurring  click interception issue to facilitate easier testing (P1).

**Future Tasks:**
-   Implement real functionality for placeholder header tabs: , , .
-   Implement a real authentication flow for the  button.
-   Build out the Calm (logged-in) state of the application.
-   Implement real video playback.
-   Replace the mocked VIA intelligence with a real, dynamic system.
-   Build out creator profiles and workspace/social tools.
-   Refactor the duplicated video card rendering logic in  and  into a single reusable component.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Fixed Broken **: Resolved the initial JSX syntax error from the previous session that caused the page to render blank.
-   **Iterative  UI/UX Overhaul**: Executed multiple, highly detailed layout passes on  based on a series of specific user prompts. This involved restructuring the page into its current, stable 3-column layout, adjusting grid proportions, component spacing, and hero  to achieve a precise above-the-fold experience on a 1366x768 viewport.
-   **Data Model Unification**:
    -   Centralized all narrative text (logline, synopsis, full plot, billing block) into .
    -   Refactored  to read all text content dynamically from the data model, removing all hardcoded strings.
    -   Added a new  tab and populated it from the  in the data model.
-   **Added New Test Content**: Added a new video entry for Mathmagical I to the data source, complete with a long , and verified it renders correctly, proving the layout's robustness.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1: Onboarding Modal click interception**
    -   **Debug checklist:** The modal in  uses . For automated or screenshot testing, this can be bypassed by evaluating  in the browser context before navigation.
    -   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?**: Fixing this would streamline testing by removing the need for manual dismissal or workarounds in test scripts.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix**: Frontend
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React (Create React App with Craco)
-   **Styling:** TailwindCSS
-   **State Management:** React  hook for local UI state (e.g., active tab).
-   **Data:** All application content is driven by a static JSON file ().

**key DB schema**
-   N/A. This is a front-end-only application using a static JSON file as its data source.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files**
-   **Heavily Modified:**
    -   : Underwent numerous, substantial rewrites to refine the UI/UX based on detailed user feedback. It is now a stable, data-driven component.
    -   : Significantly updated to implement a unified narrative model. Added new fields (, , , ) and a new video entry (Mathmagical I).
-   **Created/Deleted (temporary files during refactoring):**
    -    (deleted)
    -    (deleted)

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The video card rendering logic is duplicated across  and  (in the discovery rails). This should be extracted into a reusable  component to improve maintainability.

**key api endpoints**
-   N/A.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user is highly detail-oriented and provides very specific layout instructions. The current state of  is the result of a long iterative process and should be considered the correct baseline.
-   **All narrative content for videos MUST be sourced from **. Do not hardcode text like loglines, synopses, or billing blocks in JSX components. Any new text-based content should be added to the data model first.
-   The  can interfere with screenshot testing. Remember to handle it, for example by using , if you need a clean view.

**documents created in this job**
-   None.

**Last 5 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User ():** Requested a cleanup of  to remove duplicate info/CTAs and add a  tab. **Status: COMPLETED.**
2.  **User ():** Requested a structural fix to ensure discovery rails are rendered in a separate section below the tab content. **Status: COMPLETED.**
3.  **User ():** Requested adding a  to the data model and displaying it in the  and  tabs without hardcoding text. **Status: COMPLETED.**
4.  **User ():** Requested unifying all narrative text fields (, , etc.) into the data model to remove all hardcoded strings. **Status: COMPLETED.**
5.  **User ():** Requested adding a new video entry (Mathmagical I) with a very long  to test the layout's expandability. **Status: COMPLETED.**

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** None.
-   **Mocked:** The entire application remains a frontend prototype. All data is from static JSON, and features like Login, video playback, and VIA functionality are not implemented.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes**: NO
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO
-   **Test files created**: []
-   **Known regressions**: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   N/A. This is a guest-only experience.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent successfully followed a long and complex series of iterative design instructions from the user. The pre-existing  issue was noted but not prioritized for a fix, which aligns with its status as an Upcoming Task.</analysis>
