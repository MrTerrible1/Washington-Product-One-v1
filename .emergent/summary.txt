<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial request was to create a fresh Vite + React project. This was abandoned due to platform limitations, and the project pivoted to building the Washington Product One v0.1 guest-only app within the existing Create React App frontend located at .

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Application Type:** A guest-only, front-end-only prototype of a video streaming platform ().
2.  **Data:** All data must be sourced from local static JSON files. No backend network calls.
3.  **Core Pages:**
    *   **OnDemand ():** A premium streaming-style landing page with a hero element, a vertical genre navigation rail, and multiple horizontally-scrolling content rails.
    *   **Content Detail ():** A detail page for a piece of content, featuring a 2-column layout with a video placeholder, metadata, primary actions, and discovery rails (More from this creator, More like this).
    *   **Broadcast Preview ():** A TV-guide style page showing a multi-channel guide with program blocks of varying widths, vertical scrolling, and a hero banner.
4.  **Key Features:**
    *   **Global Shell:** A persistent header with route-aware active tabs for  and . The header also contains a context-sensitive secondary row of tabs.
    *   **Onboarding:** A 3-step modal that appears once per browser session.
    *   **Mocked VIA:** A Visual Intelligence Agent (VIA) ribbon and slide-out panel that displays mocked, context-aware insights. The copy has been updated to frame it as a preview of a future Calm (logged-in) state feature for search and routing.
    *   **Event Spine:** A client-side  logging system that captures user interactions and logs them to the console.

**what currently exists?**
The project is a single CRA/Craco React application in . It implements the Washington Product One v0.1 guest experience. It features a data-driven OnDemand page with a left navigation rail, a full-featured Content Detail page, and a multi-channel Broadcast Preview page with a vertically scrollable schedule. The UI has undergone multiple significant refinement passes to improve layout, density, readability, and component hierarchy, resulting in a polished, modern dark-themed application styled with TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: The agent was executing a final UI/UX fix pass based on the user's detailed instructions. The goal was to fix visual hierarchy, tab sizing, and styling issues on the Broadcast page.
  - Making all program blocks in the Broadcast schedule a uniform height and a distinct blue color.
  - Correcting the header tab hierarchy in  to have large, prominent primary tabs (OnDemand/Broadcast) and a single, medium-sized context tab row.
  - Ensuring the Broadcast-specific filters are rendered within the page, not the global .
  - Implementing a reliable and visible billing block tooltip that appears on hover for The Long Night program.
- **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- **Agent Testing Done**: Y
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: screenshot tool (To verify the updated UI on the  and  pages and to confirm the tooltip functionality).
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Verify Final UI/UX Fixes (P0)**
    - The agent has just completed the final UI hierarchy and styling pass. The agent has taken one screenshot of the OnDemand page, which looks correct. The next logical step is to continue verification, especially for the Broadcast page to confirm the uniform blue blocks and the working tooltip.
    - **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- **Issue 2: Onboarding Modal Intercepts Clicks (P1)**
    - An earlier automated test failed because the  appears on first load and blocks interaction. This was also observed during manual screenshot verification. While not a blocker for development, it will prevent any future automated testing.
    - **Status**: NOT STARTED
    - **Is recurring issue?** Y

**In progress Task List**:
None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - Address user feedback on the latest round of UI/UX changes (P0).
- **Future Tasks:**
  - Implement real functionality for the placeholder tabs in the header: , , .
  - Implement a real authentication flow for the  button.
  - Build out the Calm (logged-in) state of the application.
  - Implement real video playback instead of placeholders.
  - Replace the mocked VIA intelligence with a real, dynamic system.
  - Build out creator profiles and workspace/social tools.
  - Refactor the duplicated video card rendering logic in  and  into a single reusable component.

**Completed work in this session**
- **UI & Layout Overhaul:** Executed multiple, extensive passes to refine the application's UI, including:
  - **Readability:** Increased font sizes and color contrast across all pages.
  - **Layout Density:** Widened the main content container () and slimmed down sidebars to show more content on screen.
  - **Header Hierarchy:** Established a clear three-level navigation hierarchy: large primary mode tabs (OnDemand/Broadcast), a medium context-aware tab row, and small page-local filter pills.
- **OnDemand Page ():**
  - Implemented a 2-column layout with a slim, vertical tab-style genre rail on the left.
  - Improved the content rail to use a CSS grid, showing more cards horizontally.
  - Wired the main Hero section to navigate to the featured content's detail page.
- **Content Page ():**
  - Completely redesigned the page into a data-driven, 2-column layout.
  - It now displays detailed video metadata, primary action buttons, creator/sponsor credits, and two functional discovery rails (More from this creator and More like this).
- **Broadcast Page ():**
  - Expanded the mock data to 10 channels to enable vertical scrolling.
  - Styled the program guide as a colored grid, with bright blue program blocks of a uniform height standing out against a dark track background.
  - Implemented a functional billing block tooltip on hover for a demo program.
  - Refined the page hierarchy, moving page-specific filters out of the global layout.
- **Data Hydration:**
  - Padded the  file to ensure all content rails have at least 8 items, making the scrolling experience feel more realistic.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- **Issue 1: Onboarding Modal click interception**
    - **Debug checklist:** The modal in  uses  to control visibility. Any test script or verification flow must either clear session storage or include steps to dismiss the modal.
    - **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** This is required for any future automated testing to run successfully without manual intervention.
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** Frontend
    - **Is recurring issue?** Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React (Create React App with Craco)
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS with a custom dark theme defined in .
- **Component Library:** shadcn/ui (used for primitives like ).
- **State Management:** React Context API for global state;  for local component state.
- **Routing:**  for client-side routing.
- **Data:** All application content is driven by static JSON files in .

**key DB schema**
N/A. This is a front-end-only application.

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files**
- **Heavily Modified:**
  - : Multiple passes to fix header hierarchy, active tab logic, and context-aware tab rows.
  - : Reworked into a 2-column layout with a vertical tab rail and a wider content grid.
  - : Significantly updated with more channels, a colored grid, uniform block styling, and a functional tooltip.
  - : Completely rewritten into a dynamic, data-driven detail page with discovery rails.
- **Modified:**
  - : Updated with new theme colors and font sizes.
  - : Updated color palette for better contrast.
  - : Updated copy to clarify VIA's purpose.
  - : Populated rails with more items to improve the scrolling demo.
  - : Updated message to align with new VIA copy.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The video card rendering logic is largely duplicated in  and . This should be extracted into a reusable  component to improve maintainability.
- The obsolete  route and its  component should be removed to clean up the codebase.

**key api endpoints**
N/A.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **This is a front-end-only prototype.** All data is from static JSON files. No backend or database is involved.
- **Pay close attention to user prompts.** The user is highly specific about visual details, including TailwindCSS class names, colors, font sizes, and spacing.
- **The UI has been iterated on extensively.** The latest user prompt () is the source of truth for the current expected state of the UI hierarchy and styling.
- **The navigation hierarchy is now fixed:**
  1.  **Primary (LayoutShell):** Large pills for , , .
  2.  **Context (LayoutShell):** Medium pills for OnDemand verticals (, , etc.).
  3.  **Page-Local (e.g., BroadcastPreviewPage):** Small pills for local filters (, , etc.).
- The **Onboarding Modal** is a known issue that can interfere with testing. You may need to manually dismiss it or adjust test scripts to handle it.

**documents created in this job**

**Last 5 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User ():** Provided detailed instructions to fix header hierarchy, tab sizing, and Broadcast page styling. **Status: Superseded by next message.**
2.  **User ():** Provided a more refined, final set of instructions to fix all outstanding UX issues. This is the definitive prompt for the last set of changes, covering uniform program blocks, tab hierarchy, and the billing block tooltip. **Status: DONE.**
3.  **Agent ():** Acknowledged the request and started work on the final fixes.
4.  **Agent ():** Sent a screenshot of the OnDemand page for verification.
5.  **Agent ():** Confirmed the OnDemand page screenshot looked correct and stated the next step was to check the Broadcast page. **Status: IN PROGRESS.**

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:** The  route is obsolete and unused.
- **Mocked:** The entire application is a mock. Key mocked features include VIA, video playback, login, and all CTAs beyond navigation and console logging.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
- **Test files created:** None
- **Known regressions:** None currently, but the billing block tooltip was fragile in earlier iterations before being fixed in the last pass.

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A. This is a guest-only experience.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent has diligently followed the user's iterative instructions. The only outstanding miss is not proactively addressing the recurring  issue, though the user has not explicitly requested a fix for it. All tasks from the latest user prompt appear to be implemented, pending final verification.</analysis>
