<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial request was to create a fresh Vite + React project. However, due to platform limitations where the preview panel was locked to a different port, this approach was abandoned.

The project then pivoted to implementing the Washington Product One v0.1 guest-only app within the existing default CRA/Craco React frontend at .

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Application Type:** A guest-only, front-end-only prototype of a video streaming platform ().
2.  **Data:** All data must be local static JSON. No network calls to a backend.
3.  **Core Pages:**
    *   **OnDemand ():** A premium streaming-style landing page with a content hero and multiple horizontally-scrolling content rails.
    *   **Content Detail ():** A detail page for a piece of content, showing a video placeholder, metadata, and a More Like This rail.
    *   **Broadcast Preview ():** A static, TV-guide style page showing a channel guide with program blocks of varying lengths.
4.  **Key Features:**
    *   **Global Shell:** A persistent header with route-aware active tabs for  and , and placeholder tabs for future features (, ) that trigger a coming soon toast.
    *   **Onboarding:** A 3-step modal that appears once per browser session.
    *   **Mocked VIA:** A Visual Intelligence Agent (VIA) ribbon and slide-out panel that displays mocked, context-aware insights based on the viewed content.
    *   **Event Spine:** A client-side  logging system that captures , , and other interactions, logging them to the console with a stub for a future event bus ().
5.  **Design:** A premium, modern, OS-like dark theme using a defined color palette and consistent spacing/typography.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a single CRA/Craco React application located in . The initial Vite project was deleted. The application implements the Washington Product One v0.1 guest-only experience. It features an OnDemand landing page, a Content Detail page, and a Broadcast Preview page. The UI is styled with a custom dark theme using TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui components. A robust client-side event logging system () is in place, and a mocked VIA (Visual Intelligence Agent) provides contextual insights from static JSON data.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: The agent was refining the  page. The changes included:
    1.  Updating the mock data for channels to include , , and .
    2.  Adding a creator-centric filter bar (e.g., All, Live Streams) below the page title.
    3.  Introducing a Station ID column to the left of the program guide, showing the channel's icon, name, and owner type.
    4.  Slightly polishing the program block visuals for better clarity.
- **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- **Agent Testing Done**: Y
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: screenshot tool (To verify the new UI on the  page).
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Verify Broadcast Page Refinements (P0)**
    -   The agent just completed a set of UI refinements on the . The user has not yet confirmed if these changes meet their expectations.
    -   **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
-   **Issue 2: Onboarding Modal Intercepts Clicks (P1)**
    -   An earlier automated test failed because the  appears on first load and blocks interaction with underlying elements. While no automated tests are currently requested, this will be a blocker for future testing.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** None. This was observed during a test run.
    -   **Next debug checklist:** For any automated testing, the script must first handle the modal by clicking Skip or Start. The component is .
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Enables reliable automated testing of the application without manual intervention.
    -   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend

**In progress Task List**:
None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - The user split the last prompt into . There may be a  with further instructions for the Broadcast page or another part of the app. (P0)
- **Future Tasks:**
  - Implement real functionality for the placeholder tabs in the header:  (Video, Music, etc.) and  (Crowdfunding, Store, etc.).
  - Implement a real authentication flow for the  button.
  - Build out the Calm (logged-in) state of the application.
  - Implement real video playback instead of placeholders.
  - Replace the mocked VIA intelligence with a real, dynamic system.
  - Build out creator profiles and workspace/social tools.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Major Pivot:** Migrated the entire project from a separate Vite application to the existing CRA/Craco frontend at  due to platform preview limitations.
- **Washington App Scaffolding:** Implemented the full Washington v0.1 guest app structure, including routing, session context, and an event spine.
- **OnDemand Page ():** Created and progressively refined the landing page into a modern, streaming-style UX with a content hero and multiple horizontal content rails.
- **Content Detail Page ():** Created a new page to display details for a selected content item, including metadata and a More Like This rail.
- **Broadcast Preview Page ():** Created and progressively refined a static TV-guide style page, culminating in a realistic network guide with variable-width program blocks.
- **Global UI/UX Polish:** Executed a major design pass, establishing a new dark theme with a  file, updating global styles in , and refining the UI of all guest-facing pages for a more premium feel.
- **Header Implementation:** Built a complex, multi-row header with route-aware active tab highlighting for  and  streams.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1: Onboarding Modal click interception**
    -   **Debug checklist:** The modal in  uses  to control visibility. Test scripts must either clear session storage or include steps to dismiss the modal.
    -   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** This is required for any future automated testing to run successfully.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** Frontend
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**
The application is a standard CRA React project located in .


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React (Create React App with Craco)
-   **Styling:** TailwindCSS with a custom dark theme defined in  using HSL CSS variables.
-   **Component Library:** shadcn/ui (for primitives like , ).
-   **State Management:** React Context API for session and VIA content state.
-   **Routing:**  for all client-side routing.
-   **Data:** All application content is driven by static JSON files in .
-   **Architecture:** Component-based architecture with a clear separation of pages, components, hooks, and context.

**key DB schema**
N/A. All data is from local JSON files.

**changes in tech stack**
The entire project was moved from a **Vite + React** setup to the pre-existing **CRA/Craco + React** stack.

**All files**
- **Created/Updated:**
  - : Created to hold JS color constants for the new theme.
  - : Heavily modified to implement a new OS-like dark theme with HSL tokens.
  - : Overhauled multiple times to achieve a premium streaming UX.
  - : Created and significantly refactored to a realistic network-guide UI.
  - : New page for content details.
  - : Heavily modified to create a complex, route-aware header.
  - , , , : All created to support the application's core logic.
- **Important Existing Files:**
  - : Main shell that wires everything together.
  - : Single source of truth for routes.
  - : Defines how CSS tokens from  are consumed.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The route  and its corresponding  component appear to be obsolete. The application now uses  and  for content details. This old route should be removed to avoid confusion.

**key api endpoints**
N/A. This is a front-end-only application with no backend API calls.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Project Pivot:** The most critical context is that the project started as a new Vite app but was **completely rebuilt** inside the existing  CRA application. Do not look for or reference the Vite project; it has been deleted.
- **Preview Panel:** The application preview is correctly bound to the CRA app running on port 3000.
- **Styling:** A new dark theme was recently implemented. All new components should use the HSL design tokens from  (e.g., , , ) and the color constants from .
- **Mocked Functionality:** All features are mocked. , , and  tabs show a coming soon toast. VIA intelligence and program playback are not real.

**documents created in this job**
- : A placeholder image created for the OnDemand hero section.
