Washington Product One • v0.1 Guest Preview
Forward Roadmap (Controlled Development Track)

This roadmap outlines the approved development direction for Washington Product One, the guest-only, no-login demo that introduces the Washington platform, VIA v0.1 simulated intelligence, the N-BUS stub, and the early UX spine.

All phases below represent approved, controlled expansions of the current v0.1 codebase.

🚀 Phase 0 — v0.1 (COMPLETE)

Status: Delivered
Goal: A stable, no-login guest experience demonstrating Washington’s core UX and VIA ribbon.

Delivered:

Vite + React scaffold

App shell + layout

Onboarding 3-step modal

OnDemand page with rails

Viewer page with vertical player shell

VIA ribbon + investigate panel

VIA v0.1 mocked intelligence (JSON-driven)

Event spine:

SESSION_START

PAGE_VIEW

CTA_CLICK

VIA open/close

N-BUS stub with fallback logging

Developer-ready repo structure

🔥 Phase 1 — v0.2 (IN PROGRESS)

Goal: Deepen realism while staying fully client-side, stable, and mock-only.

1. UX Enhancements

Polished button states

Hover/focus states

Micro-interactions (fade/slide transitions)

Smooth rail scroll

2. VIA Ribbon & Insights

Cycling insights messages

Time-based ribbon rotation

Improved insight cards

3. Viewer Page

Better vertical video placeholder

Mock player controls (play/pause UI only)

Simple “related content” block on the right

4. Event Spine Expansion

Add:

PLAYER_EVENT (play/pause)

SCROLL_EVENT (rail scroll position)

ONBOARDING_EVENT (step interactions)

5. Developer Tooling

Prettier config

ESLint expanded rules

Add .editorconfig

🚧 Phase 2 — v0.3

Goal: Introduce richer IA + early personalization simulation.

Washington Information Architecture

Add Product 2: Social/Discovery Shell (static, mock-only)

Begin wiring “tabs” in the header

Prep layout for future Workspaces

VIA v0.3 (still mocked)

Ribbon responds to simple on-page events

Investigate panel pulls rail-aware suggestions

Add early “persona switching” simulated stub

Content Experience

Add episodic grouping for series

Add filters: “All”, “Shorts”, “Trending”, “Recommended”

Event System

Add:

FILTER_EVENT

TAB_NAV_EVENT

RECOMMENDATION_EVENT

🧩 Phase 3 — v0.5

Goal: Move toward full-platform UX simulation.

Multi-Product Shell (no auth)

Product 1: OnDemand

Product 2: Social/Discovery (mocked)

Product 3: Workspace entry (mocked)

VIA v0.5

Simulated “insight history”

Multi-step investigate flows

Ribbon becomes fully dynamic

N-BUS Simulation

Local state machine to mimic event routing

Debug panel showing event flow

Onboarding v2

Pathing based on user click behavior

Branching onboarding narrative

⚡ Phase 4 — v0.9

Goal: Pre-production prototype quality.

Fully Integrated UX Flow (still no backend)

Product switching

Seamless state transitions

Complete dummy content libraries

Workspace → Editor → Back transitions

VIA v0.9

Multi-panel insights

“Why am I seeing this?” mock panel

Early predicted actions simulation

Developer Tools

Add Cypress or Playwright tests

Automated screen diff checks

Lint + test + typecheck GitHub Actions

🏁 Phase 5 — v1.0 (Prototype Candidate)

Goal: The first true Washington UX prototype.

What v1.0 Represents

Stable

Cohesive

Fully navigable

Predictive-feeling VIA

Complete IA skeleton

Multi-product shell

High polish

Demo-ready for investors, execs, and partners

Still Mock Only

No backend

No real VIA

No account system

No persistence

This is intentional: v1.0 is a pure UX prototype, not a production system.

🧭 Governance & Approvals

Only the following can approve roadmap movement:

Ivan Hayden (product + creative authority)

Lead Engineer (TBD) (technical feasibility + architecture)

Roadmap changes must be submitted as PRs to /docs/ROADMAP.md with justification.
