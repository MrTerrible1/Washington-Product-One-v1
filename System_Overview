 Washington Product One — System Overview
This document explains, at a high level, **what Washington is**, **what Product One does**, and **how the major subsystems fit together**.  
It is designed for executives, new engineers, AI specialists, and anyone onboarding into the Washington ecosystem.

It focuses on clarity and conceptual alignment rather than deep technical detail.

# 1. What is Washington?

Washington is a **multi-vertical consumption OS** — not a streaming service, not a social feed, and not a siloed content platform.

Its purpose is:

### ➜ To unify all forms of content  
(video, audio, books, games, products)

### ➜ To understand the viewer  
via VIA’s evolving predictive engine

### ➜ To guide the viewer  
through personalized journeys across all media

### ➜ To connect creators, brands, and audiences  
through metadata, prediction, and negotiation (Mentor)

# 2. What is Product One?

Product One v0.1 is the **first live preview** of Washington.

It is deliberately small:

### ✓ Guest-only experience  
### ✓ OnDemand landing page  
### ✓ Viewer page  
### ✓ Rails-based content browsing  
### ✓ VIA ribbon + investigate panel  
### ✓ Onboarding modal  
### ✓ Static JSON content  
### ✓ Structured event logging  
### ✓ N-BUS stub for future transport

There is **no login, no backend, no analytics layer, no creator workflow, and no AI reasoning** in this version.

Product One is the *presentation shell* used to build and test VIA’s real intelligence later.

# 3. High-Level Architecture

Washington Product One has four major layers:

User Interface (React + Vite)
↓
WashingtonEvent Spine (event logging)
↓
VIA Subsystem (mocked)
↓
Static Data (local JSON)

markdown
Copy code

### UI Layer
Responsible for:
- Layout shell
- Navigation
- Rails
- Viewer
- VIA ribbon & panel
- Modal interactions

### Event Spine
Provides:
- Unified event schema
- Logging for every user action
- Device/session tracking
- Future transport via N-BUS

### VIA Subsystem
Three parts:
- Face (visible UI)
- Spine (receives events)
- Brain (static insights only in v0.1)

### Static Data Layer
Includes:
- videoContent.json (rails + metadata)
- viaInsights.json (static insights)

There is **no server**, **no database**, and **no AI model** in v0.1.

---

# 4. Routing Overview

Washington uses a **two-route system**:

/ → landing rails
/watch/:id → vertical viewer page

yaml
Copy code

Routing automatically triggers PAGE_VIEW events.

---

# 5. Event Spine Overview

Product One uses a standard event type system:

| Type              | Meaning |
|-------------------|---------|
| SESSION_START     | User session begins |
| PAGE_VIEW         | Route viewed |
| CTA_CLICK         | Any clickable UI action |
| PLAYER_EVENT      | Play/pause interactions |
| ONBOARDING_EVENT  | Modal interactions |

The event spine is used to:

1. Drive VIA’s future learning  
2. Validate UX journey flow  
3. Provide analytics for product decisions  
4. Power recommendation models in v0.2–v0.5  

Events are currently logged only to console and forwarded to N-BUS if it exists.

---

# 6. VIA Subsystem Overview

VIA is built to become the intelligence engine of Washington.

But in Product One v0.1:

### VIA “Face” (active)
- Ribbon  
- Message cycling  
- Investigate panel  
- Mic button (UI only)

### VIA “Spine” (passive)
- Accepts all WashingtonEvents  
- Pipes to N-BUS if available  
- No actual reasoning

### VIA “Brain” (mocked)
- Static insights  
- Static message sets  
- Hardcoded JSON rules  

VIA never predicts anything in v0.1.  
The illusion of intelligence is purely UI-driven.

---

# 7. Content Model Overview

Washington uses **rails** instead of feeds.

Each rail contains:
- `id`
- `title`
- `items[]`
- Full-support metadata for:
  - genre
  - format
  - episodic
  - vertical/horizontal
  - etc.

Rails are future-friendly for VIA:
- VIA can re-order rails
- VIA can surface recommended rails
- VIA can generate custom rails per session
- VIA can merge content across verticals

Rails are the backbone of Washington’s multi-vertical future.

---

# 8. Viewer Page Overview

The viewer is intentionally simple:
- Vertical video placeholder
- Metadata panel
- Play/pause (stub)
- Back to landing
- VIA accessible

Minimalism is intentional:
- Easy to understand  
- Easy to test  
- Easy to connect to predictive models  
- Easy to replace with a real player later  

---

# 9. Onboarding Modal Overview

The modal exists to:

1. Establish guest-only nature  
2. Clarify VIA is mocked  
3. Empower the viewer with “you’re in control” messaging  

It consists of exactly 3 steps and fires ONBOARDING_EVENT.

This is foundational for all future experiences.

---

# 10. N-BUS Overview

N-BUS is a **future distributed event transport pipeline**.

In Product One:
- If N-BUS exists → publish events
- If not → console log fallback

This future-proofs the architecture without adding backend complexity.

---

# 11. Future Direction

Product One is foundational.  
Everything after it builds on the shell and behavior defined here.

### Coming in future versions:

- VIA real prediction engine  
- Multi-device continuity  
- Creator workspace  
- Brand marketplace & negotiation (Mentor)  
- Viewer identity graph  
- Collaborative consumption journeys  
- Real media ingestion  
- Cross-vertical content browsing  
- Social layer  
- Customizable rails  
- Personalized content routing  
- Full transport via N-BUS  
- AI-driven user modeling  

Product One is the seed —  
VIA and Washington bloom in versions v0.2–v1.0.
