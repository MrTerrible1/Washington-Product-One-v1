Contributing to Washington Product One (v0.1 — Guest Preview)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Washington ecosystem.
This repository represents Product One v0.1 — Guest-Only Preview, which serves as the public-facing demonstration of the Washington UX, VIA v0.1 mocked intelligence layer, and the early event spine.

This document explains how to contribute safely, consistently, and in alignment with the project vision.

🔥 Core Principles

Stability first — Product One is a live demo for pitch, testing, and early UX validation.
All contributions should preserve stability and avoid introducing regressions.

Washington Event Spine is sacred —
Event shapes, naming conventions, and IDs must match /src/events/* and cannot be altered without explicit approval.

Mock-only environment —
No backend calls, no persistence, no FastAPI.
VIA is a mocked simulation only.

Pixel-perfect UX consistency —
UI changes must align with the Washington design direction and existing components.

Small PR philosophy —
Every change should be scoped, reviewed, tested, and isolated.

📁 Repository Structure (Simplified)
/src
  /components
  /context
  /data
  /events
  /hooks
  /pages
  /routes
  /styles
  /via

🛠 Development Workflow
1. Fork → Branch → PR model

Developers should:

git checkout -b feature/my-feature-name


Branch naming:

feature/* — new features

fix/* — bug fixes

ui/* — design/UI changes

docs/* — documentation-only changes

▶ Local Development (Vite)
yarn
yarn dev


Preview appears automatically in the IDE environment (e.g., Emergent, Codespaces, etc).

🔎 Testing Your Changes

Before submitting a PR:

Load /

Complete onboarding once

Click into a video tile

Open VIA Ribbon

Toggle Investigate Panel

Check browser console for:

SESSION_START

PAGE_VIEW

CTA_CLICK

Investigate events

Ensure no unexpected console errors

🎯 Pull Request Requirements

Every PR must:

Include a clear title and summary

Describe why the change is needed

Confirm that the preview loads and runs end-to-end

Include screenshots for UI updates

Tag any files altered in /events or the event spine

PRs changing the event system must include:

Before/After event examples

Updated event documentation

Confirmation that event shape remains canonical

❌ What Not to Do

Do not add any backend code

Do not introduce database calls

Do not modify VIA behavior beyond the mocked scope

Do not rename directories without approval

Do not merge without review

🧩 Design Consistency Rules

Always use existing button and layout classes

Maintain spacing/padding patterns already in styles/

Do not introduce new color tokens unless approved

Follow responsive behaviors defined in existing components

🗳 Decision-Making Authority

Product authority:

Ivan Hayden — Vision, UX, event spine, product direction

Technical authority:

Tech Lead role (TBD) — Code architecture, gatekeeping, review workflow
(Until assigned, follow the repository owner).

📝 Code Standards
JavaScript / React

Use functional components

Use hooks (no class components)

Avoid large components — split into smaller parts

Keep imports clean and sorted

Keep business logic out of UI components

Events

Always use EVENT_TYPES.

Always use logEvent().

Never hardcode event type strings inline.

📚 Documentation Updates

If your change impacts:

UI behavior

Events

VIA behavior

Routing

Data structure

You must update the corresponding .md files under /docs.
