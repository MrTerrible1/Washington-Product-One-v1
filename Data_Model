Washington Product One — Data Model
This document defines the **content and insight data models** used in Washington Product One v0.1.  
It also establishes the forward-compatible schema that future versions of Washington (v0.2–v1.0) will expand into.

The data model is foundational.  
It drives:
- Rails
- Content discovery
- Viewer page
- VIA insights
- Event payloads
- Future prediction systems
- Metadata extraction and ingestion

---

# 1. High-Level Philosophy

Washington is not just a streaming platform — it is a **multi-vertical consumption OS**.

Therefore, the data model must:

### ✓ Support multiple media types  
(video, audio, books, courses, games, products)

### ✓ Support predictive features  
View duration, affinities, categories, formats, verticals.

### ✓ Support episodic content  
Shows, seasons, episodes.

### ✓ Support VIA insights  
Per-content recommendation hooks.

### ✓ Support continuous expansion  
Future verticals (music, docs, live streams, etc.).

**Product One only uses a *slice* of this system**, but the structure is designed to scale.

---

# 2. Core Files

Washington Product One uses two primary static data files:

/src/data/videoContent.json
/src/data/viaInsights.json

yaml
Copy code

These will evolve into backend API responses in v0.3+.

---

# 3. Content File: videoContent.json

### Top-Level Structure (Rails)

The landing page uses a **rails** system:

```json
{
  "rails": [
    {
      "id": "featured",
      "title": "Featured",
      "items": [ ... ]
    },
    {
      "id": "tours",
      "title": "Tours",
      "items": [ ... ]
    }
  ]
}
Each rail contains:

id → unique identifier

title → display name

items[] → array of content objects

This structure supports:

Query-based rails

Personalized rails

Multi-vertical rails

VIA-generated rails (future)

4. Content Item Schema
Each item inside rails[].items[] must follow this pattern:

json
Copy code
{
  "id": "wash-101",
  "title": "Welcome to Washington",
  "meta": "Product tour • 3 min vertical session",
  "duration": "3:02",
  "genre": "product",
  "format": "vertical",
  "isSeries": false,
  "season": null,
  "episodeNumber": null
}
Field Definitions
Field	Type	Purpose
id	string	Unique content identifier used across all systems
title	string	User-visible title
meta	string	Short summary that appears on cards
duration	string	Human-readable duration (mm:ss)
genre	string	Category (product, tutorial, concept, etc.)
format	string	vertical, horizontal, audio, etc.
isSeries	boolean	Whether the content has episodic structure
season	number/null	Optional season #
episodeNumber	number/null	Optional episode #

These fields allow Washington to:

Render cards

Route to viewer pages

Generate VIA insights

Infer future personalization

Connect multi-vertical content types

5. Future-Ready Metadata (Not Used in v0.1)
Washington’s schema is versioned to grow into:

Field	Purpose
vertical	Media vertical (video, audio, book, product, etc.)
language	Internationalization support
creators[]	Multi-creator metadata
tags[]	Prediction keywords
contentRating	MPAA / ESRB-like
releaseDate	Time-based sorting
thumbnailUrl	Dynamic asset ingestion
posterUrl	High-res art
audioTrack	For accessibility
captions[]	Subtitles

These are intentionally not included in Product One to keep the MVP simple.

6. Insight File: viaInsights.json
This file powers VIA’s mocked “brain.”

It contains two sections:

json
Copy code
{
  "ribbonMessages": [ ... ],
  "contentInsights": {
    "wash-101": { ... },
    "wash-102": { ... },
    "default": { ... }
  }
}
6.1 Ribbon Messages
Displayed inside the VIA ribbon:

json
Copy code
"ribbonMessages": [
  "Exploring Washington? VIA is here to help.",
  "Tap ‘Open Insights’ to see more.",
  "These insights are simulated for preview."
]
6.2 Insight Schema
Each insight object:

json
Copy code
{
  "title": "Example Insight",
  "summary": "A brief explanation of this insight.",
  "tags": ["engagement", "tutorial"]
}
Fields:

title → displayed in panel

summary → explanation

tags[] → future vectorization for recommendations

6.3 Default Insight
Used when:

No contentId set

Unknown id

Landing page

7. Insight Lookup Rules
Defined in:

scss
Copy code
viaClient.js → investigateContent()
Rules:

If contentId exists in contentInsights → return it

Else → return "default"

Never return null

Must be pure and synchronous

This behavior gives VIA predictable, testable output.

8. Cross-System Integration
Washington’s data model powers:

1. UI
Cards

Viewer

Metadata displays

Rails

2. Event system
Payloads include:

railId

videoId

title

contentId

3. VIA
Lookup for insights

Ribbon messages

Per-content panels

VIA personality tuning later

4. Routing
Viewer routes use:

/watch/:id

Flattened rails for global lookup

9. How the Data Model Scales
This schema is intentionally crafted to expand into:

v0.2
Real ingestion

More metadata fields

Early personalization

v0.3
Multimodal content

Cross-vertical rails

VIA-generated rails

v0.4
Viewer identity graph

Content scoring

Multi-device continuity

v1.0
Creator/Brand metadata

Negotiation graph (Mentor)

AI-powered content taxonomies

Graph-based recommendations

Product One provides the lowest complexity slice necessary to bootstrap VIA.
