Washington Product One — Design Notes
This document explains the design philosophy, UI/UX structure, and layout decisions behind **Washington Product One v0.1**.  
It acts as the single source of truth for all designers, front-end engineers, and future UX contributors.

Product One is not a full product.  
It is a **UX training ground** and **predictive sandbox** for VIA.

These design notes must remain stable until Product Two.

# 1. Design Philosophy

Washington is not a streaming site, not a short-form video app, and not a content feed.

It is a **multi-vertical consumption OS** with:

- predictive intelligence (VIA)  
- multi-device continuity  
- vertical metadata rails  
- unified content ontology  
- passive/active discovery modes  

Product One extracts the *core experience* of Washington into a minimal demo:

> **A frictionless viewer journey in a predictive shell.**

Everything about the UI serves that idea.

# 2. Visual Hierarchy

The entire system is designed around three layers of visual attention:

### Layer 1 — **The Content (Primary)**
Content must always dominate:
- Rails
- Cards
- Vertical players
- Thumbnails
- Summaries

Washington is a consumption OS — the media is the center of gravity.

### Layer 2 — **The Shell (Secondary)**
Navigation and containers:
- LayoutShell
- Section headers
- Rails
- Back button
- Player metadata

Always present but visually neutral.

### Layer 3 — **VIA, the Presence (Tertiary)**
VIA is always visible but never overwhelming:
- Ribbon at bottom  
- Investigate panel  
- Mic button  

The design goal is to communicate:

> “VIA is here, not in the way.”

---

# 3. Layout Shell

The **LayoutShell** is Washington’s global frame.

It provides:

- Logo area  
- OnDemand tab  
- Guest badge  
- Main content container  
- Persistent VIA ribbon  
- Mount point for Investigate panel  

Design constraints:

1. **It must never shift** vertically or horizontally.  
2. **It must keep enough bottom space** for VIA ribbon.  
3. **It must not contain business logic.**  
4. **It must feel like a true OS shell, not a webpage.**

---

# 4. Rails System (OnDemand Landing)

Washington uses horizontal rails instead of feeds or grids because:

- Rails are predictable  
- Rails support multi-vertical expansion  
- Rails can be reordered by prediction  
- Rails scale across devices  
- Rails are easy to learn  

Each rail contains:
- Title (“Featured”, “Concepts”, etc.)  
- Horizontal scrollable area  
- Content cards  

This structure represents Washington’s future knowledge graph.

---

# 5. Content Cards

Cards are designed for clarity, not flavor.

They include:

- Thumbnail placeholder  
- Duration tag  
- Format tag (“Vertical”)  
- Title  
- Meta summary  
- Clear click area  

Cards must always:

- Fire clean `CTA_CLICK` events  
- Navigate immediately  
- Set `currentContentId`  
- Feel predictable  

No card has hover states that reveal hidden behavior — this is deliberate for consistency across devices.

---

# 6. Viewer Page (Vertical Experience)

The Viewer is intentionally simple in v0.1:

- Vertical video placeholder  
- Metadata panel  
- Back link  
- Play/Pause buttons (stub)  

Design priorities:

1. Direct  
2. Clean  
3. Zero distraction  
4. VIA accessible but optional  

The real vertical player will replace the placeholder in v0.2 or v0.3 when the media pipeline comes online.

---

# 7. Onboarding Modal

The modal is meant to:
- communicate that this is a **guest preview**
- introduce VIA’s limitations honestly
- reassure users they control the experience

Design rules:

- 3 steps only  
- Centered  
- Dim background  
- Big, readable text  
- Minimal buttons  

The modal must not:
- feel like a signup
- feel like friction
- overwhelm the user

It is a gentle primer, not a barrier.

---

# 8. VIA Ribbon & Panel

### Ribbon:
- Always visible  
- Expands/collapses  
- Shows canned messages  
- Offers “Open Insights” CTA  
- Never covers important UI  

### Investigate Panel:
- Slides in from the right  
- Shows insight card list  
- Uses content-specific insights when available  
- Closes on CTA  

These elements give VIA a sense of presence and personality without any intelligence.

---

# 9. Mobile-First Theory

Washington is built for **vertical, mobile-native content**.

Design rules:

1. Vertical player is always 9:16  
2. Controls must be reachable by thumb  
3. Scrollable rails must be touch-friendly  
4. VIA ribbon must never block content  
5. No hidden gestures in v0.1  

Even on desktop, UI should feel like a mobile OS projected onto a larger surface.

---

# 10. Accessibility Notes

- All interactive elements must have ARIA labels.  
- All buttons must have clear focus states.  
- All modals must trap focus.  
- Ribbon toggle needs descriptive text.  
- Panel must be announced to screen readers.  

These rules are foundational.  
Future versions will expand into WCAG compliance.

---

# 11. Branding Notes

Washington does not use heavy branding in v0.1:

- No strong colors  
- No gradients  
- No mascot  
- No deep brand language yet  

The purpose is to maintain clarity until:
- Creator modes exist  
- Brand marketplace exists  
- VIA personalization exists  
- Multi-vertical themes develop  

Brand identity will emerge in v0.2–v0.5.

---

# 12. What Must Not Change in v0.1

- Overall layout shell structure  
- Ribbon placement  
- Panel placement  
- Rail structure  
- Onboarding steps  
- Viewer layout  
- Investigate triggers  
- Static JSON → UI mapping  

These are locked for compatibility with the predictive engine coming later.
